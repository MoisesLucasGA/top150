 * 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.

class TreeNode {
  val: number;
  left: TreeNode | null;
  right: TreeNode | null;

  constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
    this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
    this.left = left === undefined ? null : left;
    this.right = right === undefined ? null : right;
  }
}

function countNodes(root: TreeNode | null): number {
  if (!root) {
    return 0;

  return 1 + countNodes(root.left) + countNodes(root.right);

const root = new TreeNode(
  1,
  new TreeNode(2, new TreeNode(4), new TreeNode(5)),
  new TreeNode(3, new TreeNode(6), new TreeNode(7))
